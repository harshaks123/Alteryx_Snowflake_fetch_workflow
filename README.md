# Alteryx Snowflake Connection and Data Upload

## Overview
This repository contains Alteryx workflows and documentation for connecting to Snowflake, filtering data, and uploading it back to Snowflake. The workflows demonstrate a simple data manipulation process using Alteryx Designer.

## Snowflake Connection

### Prerequisites
- An active Snowflake account with necessary permissions to connect and perform operations.
- Alteryx Designer installed on your local machine.

### Instructions
1. **Install Snowflake ODBC Driver**: If you haven't already, download and install the Snowflake ODBC driver on your machine.
   
2. **Configure ODBC Connection**: Set up an ODBC connection to your Snowflake instance. Use the Snowflake account credentials and other necessary connection details provided by your Snowflake administrator.

3. **Alteryx Snowflake Connector**: In Alteryx Designer, use the "Input Data" tool to connect to Snowflake. Choose ODBC as the connection type and select the configured Snowflake ODBC DSN (Data Source Name).

4. **Authentication**: Depending on your Snowflake configuration, choose the appropriate authentication method (e.g., username/password, OAuth).

5. **Query Data**: Write SQL queries or select tables/views to retrieve data from Snowflake.

## Alteryx Workflow Details

### Snowflake Data Extraction
- The workflow starts with an Input Data tool configured to connect to Snowflake using the ODBC connection created earlier.
- SQL queries or table selections are used to extract the desired data from Snowflake.
- Additional data cleaning or transformation steps can be added as needed.

### Data Filtering
- After extracting data from Snowflake, a Filter tool is applied to perform basic data filtering based on specified conditions.
- Adjust the filter conditions according to your data requirements.

### Data Upload to Snowflake
- Once the data is filtered, an Output Data tool is configured to upload the filtered data back to Snowflake.
- Choose the appropriate output connection (e.g., Snowflake ODBC) and specify the target table where the filtered data will be uploaded.
- Ensure that the target table exists in Snowflake and that the schema matches the data being uploaded.

## INDB Tools Usage

### Overview
INDB (In-Database) tools in Alteryx allow for processing data directly within the database, reducing data movement and improving performance.

### Considerations
- Use INDB tools when working with large datasets to leverage the processing power of the database server.
- Ensure that your database supports the required operations and functions used in your workflow.

### Integration with Snowflake
- Alteryx provides INDB tools compatible with various databases, including Snowflake.
- Configure the INDB tools to connect to Snowflake using the appropriate connection settings and credentials.
- Leverage INDB tools for tasks such as data filtering, aggregation, and joins directly within Snowflake.
